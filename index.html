                “You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great - and that’s what being a spacefaring 
                civilization is all about. It’s about believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. 
                And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars.”

                The ultimate goal of SpaceX is to make space travel available for almost anyone. We also wish to make space travel
                something people look to with excitement again, the way everyone was captivated by the first mission to the moon -
                Apollo 11. 
                
                To make this possible, we are working
                on decreasing the cost and improving the reliability of access to space. One step we have taken towards this goal is
                developing our rapidly reusable launch system - A way to reuse rockets by landing them back on to their launch pads.

                    <p>
                        Our largest goal is to make humanity an interplanetary species. The first step in doing this is by colonizing Mars,
                        the nearest habitable planet to Earth. Once we can survive - and possibly thrive - on Mars, we can work on 
                        inhabiting other planets further away from
                        Earth.
                        <br>
                        Why colonize Mars in the first place? Pure curiosity, the potential for humans to provide more in-depth 
                        observational research than unmanned rovers, economic interest in its resources, and the possibility that if our
                        home is destroyed, humanity as a race will carry on.
